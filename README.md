Bluffing Detection:
Bluffing is a critical aspect of poker, and detecting potential bluffs can give you a significant advantage. You can use machine learning algorithms to analyze historical gameplay data to identify patterns that might indicate bluffing. Features like betting patterns, player behavior, and previous actions can be used to train a bluffing detection model. Reinforcement learning can also be employed to let the AI play against itself and learn bluffing strategies over time.

Hand Strength Prediction:
Predicting the strength of a player's hand is crucial for making informed decisions during a poker game. You can use AI to develop a model that takes the community cards and betting actions into account to estimate the probability of each player having different hands. This can involve techniques such as Monte Carlo simulations, Bayesian inference, or even training a neural network on a large dataset of poker hands.

Opponent Modeling:
Building an AI that can adapt its strategy based on the playing style of opponents is a complex task. You can utilize machine learning to create opponent models that categorize players into different archetypes (e.g., tight-aggressive, loose-passive) and then use these models to make decisions accordingly. Reinforcement learning can also be employed to allow the AI to improve its strategies by playing against various opponent types.

Calculating Win Percentage:
The win percentage is a fundamental metric in poker that represents a player's expected return on investment. AI can help you calculate win percentages based on the player's hand strength, community cards, and potential opponent hands. By simulating numerous poker scenarios, you can estimate the likelihood of winning the hand and use this information to make more informed decisions.
